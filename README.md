TextStream: A (not quite) simple way to display text on daisy chained LEDs

To build evoke `make test' from the terminal while in this directory. If the
build succeeded, you'll see a test_prog ELF in the build folder. (Be prepared
for a lot of warning messages, all intimating about a deprecated conversion
from string to char *. Please ignore these, nothing is broken.)
